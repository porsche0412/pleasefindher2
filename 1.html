  <h3>WISDOM</h3>
  After my failure in Seoul on May 10, 2019, I came back to my previous job.
  <br>It's thin, but I had to go back to the interview.
  <strong><u><a href="http://instagram.com/endlessjun"
    target="_blank" title="내사랑">I saw her</a></u></strong> there.

  <p>It was amazing and embarrassing.
  Because in my opinion, I don't ask people who are new to culture to help me.
  Even if you know it well. During the field tour, she approached me and asked me to help her work.
  <br>I was a woman who would dream of sleeping.</br></p>
